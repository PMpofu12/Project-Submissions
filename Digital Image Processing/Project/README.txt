1. FOLDER STRUCTURE:
	- sudoku_database stores all of the Sudoku puzzles used in the project.

	- DIP project.ipynb is the notebook used in the project. 

	- mnist.h5 is a pretrained model that you will need to load for section 4 of the project. Comments are provided in
	  the notebook

2. RUNNING THE NOTEBOOK:
	- Do not "Run All" as this will train the CNN and that takes up a lot of time. Just run each cell individually to see
	  all of the relevant output. 

	- Do not run the cell under 4.4 Model Training. The CNN model can be loaded from the mnist.h5 file. 

	- Otherwise, the notebook is well commented and has everything you would need to see our project.
